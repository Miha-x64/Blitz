# Blitz
Blitz! â€” lightning fast primitive collections for Java

I work with sets of longs every day. SQLite promary keys and many other things are longs. So I've written these collections: MutableLongTreeSet and ImmutableLongTreeSet.

This project is currently work in progress. I'll be glad to see your suggestions and feature requests, and API is a subject to change.
